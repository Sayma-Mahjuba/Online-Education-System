 <h2> Introduction </h2>
 <h4>Definition - What does C++ Programming Language (C++) mean? </h3>
 <p>C++ is a programming language which is a superset of the C language. The C language is known as C language because it is a successor of B language and was developed by Dennis Ritchie. C++ is a middle level programming language and it is developed by Bjarne Stroustrup in 1979 at Bell Labs as the extension to C language and was originally named as C with Classes but later it was renamed as C++ in 1983. The C++ language can run on various platforms like Windows, Mac OS, and even on various versions of UNIX. The C++ is an object oriented language. This C++ tutorial will help new learners to understand all C++ concepts in easy way with examples.</p>
 <h4>What are the features of C++ language?</h4>
 <p>C++ is a programming language which includes the main four pillars of object oriented development. Those concepts are: </p>
 <ol>
 <li>Data Hiding</li>
 <li>Inheritance</li>
 <li>Encapsulation</li>
<li> Polymorphism</li>
</ol>
<h2>C++ DATA TYPES & MODIFIERS</h2>
<p>Data types are used to define the variables that the same of type data it can store in memory. The data types determine the type of data to be stored in memory. The data types are used to represent the different values to be stored in the variable,</p>
<h2>C++ IDENTIFIERS, KEYWORDS</h2>
<p>To identify a class, variable, function or any of the other user defined item you use identifiers so, this concept is known as Identifiers. The identifier starts with a letter ‘A’ to ‘Z’ or ‘a’ to ‘z’ or from underscore (_) followed by zero or more letters, underscores and digits (0 to 9)…</p>
<h2>C++ CONSTANTS</h2>
<p>The constants can be referred as fixed values that the program cannot change, it cannot be altered. The constants are also known as Literals. They are initialized at the time of creation and new values cannot be assigned later</p>
<h2>C++ VARIABLES</h2>
<p>Variables are used to store the values which can be modified later on in the program. The variables can be declared in many ways and every way with different memory requirements. It is a name of memory location that is allocated by the compiler depending upon the data type of the variable</p>
<h2>C++ OPERATORS & EXPRESSIONS</h2>
<p>The operators are the special type of functions that takes one or more parameters and gives new result. It is a symbol that tells the compiler to perform the mathematical and logical manipulations. The programming language like C or C++ is incomplete without the use of operators.</p>
<h2>C++ DECISION CONTROL STATEMENTS</h2>
<p>The decision control statements are the decision making statements that decides the order of execution of statements based on the conditions. In the decision making statements the programmer specify which conditions are to be executed or tested with the statements to be executed if the condition is true or false.</p>
<h2>C++ LOOP CONTROL STATEMENTS</h2>
<p>The loops are needed to execute a block of code many of the times. In this, basically the statements are executed sequentially which means the first statement in a function is executed first than the second statement and so on. The loops are used to execute a single statement or the group of statements multiple times.</p>
<h2>C++ TYPE QUALIFIERS</h2
<p>The type qualifiers are like a token which is added to a variable and it adds an extra quality like specifying constant-ness to a variable. It provides one or two properties to an identifier. The type qualifier can appear with any type specifier but they cannot appear after first comma in a multiple item declaration.</p>
<h2>C++ STORAGE CLASS SPECIFIERS</h2>
<p>The storage specifiers define the scope or visibility and the lifetime of the variable or function within a program.The lifetime is a duration till which the variable will remain active and visibility is in which the module of the program the variable is accessible.</p>
<h2>C++ ARRAYS</h2>
<p>An array is a collection of similar elements of same data type at a contiguous memory location. The array is a data structure which stores the fixed size of elements in sequence.The size and the data type of an array cannot be changed after the declaration.</p>
<h2>C++ STRINGS</h2>
<p>The string is an object of the string class and it is defined in the header file i.e. <string.h>.The string class has many constructors that are called to create a string object.It represents the sequence of characters. The operations which can be performed on strings are comparison, concatenation, conversion, etc</p>
<h2>C++ POINTERS</h2>
<p>Pointers are one of the best features of C++ in comparison to other programming languages like Java, Python etc. It is a variable whose value is the address for another variable.We need to declare the variable as a pointer if we want to use pointers with variable.</p>
<h2>C++ STRUCTURES</h2>
<p>In C++, structure is a combination or group of different data elements that are grouped together under a single name.The data elements are known as data members who have different data type and length.It is a user defined data type that allows you to combine data items of different kinds.</p>
<h2>C++ ENUMERATION</h2>
<p>Enumerations are a user defined data type which consist integral constants. In this, you can specify a set of values for a variable and the variable can select only one out of the set. It has a fixed set of constants.To define enumerations we use ‘enum’ keyword. Enumerations can be used to define days of a week, month, weathers, etc.</p>
<h2>C++ FRIEND FUNCTIONS</h2>
<p>If we define a function as a friend function then the protected and privated data of a class can be accessed using the function.The friend can be a function, a function template or member function, a class or a class template.</p>
<h2>C++ VIRTUAL FUNCTIONS</h2>
<p>The virtual functions must be declared in the public section of the class.They are always defined in base class and overridden in derived class but it is not mandatory to override in derived class.The virtual functions should be accessed.</p>
<h2>C++ FUNCTIONS</h2>
<p>Functions are a group of statements or set of statements that perform the task together. In C++, every program has at least a single function that is a main( ). The functions take the inputs and perform the task on those inputs.</p>
<h2>C++ FUNCTION OVERLOADING</h2>
<p>Overloading means the use of the same thing for different purposes. Function Overloading is a most important feature of C++ in which two or more functions can have the same name but different parameters or arguments for the different tasks.</p>
<h4>WHAT IS TIME( ) IN C++?</h4>
<p>In C++, the time( ) function will return the current calendar time as an object of type time_t.
The C++ standard library does not provide a proper data type for date and time it inherits the structs and functions for date and time manipulation from C.
To access the date and time related functions you need to include <ctime> header file. The four types of time are time_t, clock_t, size_t and tm.</p>
<p>Now, before learning the C++ language, you need to learn that how to write and compile the programs in C++ language. To understand the program briefly let us have a look at the example:</p>
<p>#include <<x>iostream></x></p>
<p>using namespace std;</p>
<p>int main()</p>
<p>{</p>
<p> cout << "Welcome to C++ World";</p>
<p>}</p>
<h4>LET US LEARN ABOUT ALL THE COMPONENTS THAT C++ PROGRAM HAVE:</h4>


<p><b>#include</b> – It includes the console input output library functions.</p>
<p><b><<x>iostream.h></x></b> – The iostream is a header file that includes the standard input output library functions. It provides cin and cout methods for reading the input and writing the output respectively.</p>
<p><b><<x>conio.h></x></b> – It is also a header file that includes clrscr() and getch() functions.</p>
<p><b>void main</b> – In the void main, main() function is the entry point of program and the void keyword does not have any return value.<p>
<p><b>clrscr()</b> – The clrscr() is used to clear the output screen whenever the program is compiled.</p>
<p><b>cout</b> – The cout method is used to print the data on the console and in this program it will print Welcome to C++ World.</p>
<p><b>getch()</b> – The getch() function is used in the program where it asks for a single character and until you press any key, it will block the screen.</p>
<h4>HOW TO COMPILE AND EXECUTE THE PROGRAM?</h4>
<p>Now, after writing the program you need to save the program. So, let us have a look how to save the file and compile the program. The following are the steps to save and compile the program:
Firstly, open a text editor and add the code as shown above and then save the file as first.cpp
After that open the command prompt and then go to the directory where you have saved the program or file.
In command prompt type ‘g++ first.cpp’ and press enter to compile the program. If there are any errors in your code firstly, correct them and if there are no errors in your code then you will be taken to next line and will generate the a.out executable file.
Now, type ‘a.out’ in command prompt to run your program and after that you will see ‘Welcome to C++ World’ on the window.</p>
<h4>WHAT IS ENCAPSULATION?</h4>
<p>In C++, the encapsulation is a process of combining data members and functions in a single unit known as class.
This is to prevent the access to the data directly and the access to them is provided through the function of the class. It is one of the most important features of object oriented programming that helps in data hiding.</p>
<p>The data encapsulation is a mechanism packing the data and the functions that use them in a single unit and data abstraction is a mechanism of exposing only the interfaces and hiding the implementation details from the user.</p>
<h4>WHAT IS ABSTRACTION?</h4>
<p>The data abstraction is one of the most essential and important feature of object oriented programming in C++. The data abstraction means displaying only essential information and hiding the details.</p>
<p>It also refers to providing only essential details about the data to the outside world hiding the background details.
In C++, the classes help us to group data members and member functions using available access specifiers. The classes decide which data member will be visible to the outside world and which is not.</p>
<p>Let us look at the real life example of TV, which we use in daily life where you can turn off and on, change the channel, increase or decrease the volume but how it is working you do not know, the internal details you do not know it just receives the signals through a cable but how it translates and displays them on the screen you do not know.</p>
<p>This is what abstraction is which hide the implementation details but shows the relevant information.</p>
<h4>WHAT IS MEMORY ALLOCATION?</h4>
<p>The memory in C++ canbe allocated in two ways:</p>
<h2>STATIC MEMORY ALLOCATION:</h2>
<p>In static memory allocation the memory is allocated for the named variables by the compiler. The size and data type of the storage must be known at the compile time.</p>
<h2>DYNAMIC MEMORY ALLOCATION:</h2>
<p>In the dynamic memory allocation the memory is allocated during run time. The space which is allocated dynamically usually placed in a program segment which is known as heap. In this, the compiler does not need to know the size in advance.
</p>
<h4>WHAT IS DYNAMIC MEMORY ALLOCATION?</h4>
<p>In C++, dynamic memory allocation means performing memory allocation manually by programmer. It is allocated on the heap and the heap is the region of a computer memory which is managed by the programmer using pointers to access the memory.
The programmers can dynamically allocate storage space while the program is running but they cannot create a new variable name.
DYNAMIC MEMORY ALLOCATION REQUIRES TWO CRITERIA:
Creating the dynamic space in memory.
Storing its address in a pointer.</p>
<h4>WHAT IS THE USE OF DYNAMIC MEMORY ALLOCATION?</h4>
<p>Dynamic Memory Allocation is to allocate memory of variable size which is not possible with compiler allocated memory except variable length arrays.
The most important use of dynamic memory allocation is the flexibility as the programmers are free to allocate and deallocate memory whenever we need and when we don’t.</p>
<h4>HOW MEMORY IS ALLOCATED AND DEALLOCATED IN C++?</h4>
<p>In C++, we can allocate and deallocate memory by using two operators new and delete operator respectively which perform the task of allocating and deallocating the memory. Let us have a discussion on these two operators.</p>
<h2> NEW OPERATOR</h2>
<p>The new operator signifies a request for memory allocation on the heap and if the sufficient memory is available then the new operator initializes the memory and returns the address of the newly allocated variable and initialized memory to the pointer variable.</p>
<h4>SYNTAX:</h4>
<p>pointer-variable = new data type;</p>
<p>Here, the pointer-variable is the pointer of type data type. Data type could be any built in data type including array or any user defined data type including class and structure.</p>
<h2>DELETE OPERATOR</h2>
<p>The delete operator is used to deallocate the memory created by new operator at runtime. Once the memory is no longer needed it should be free so that the memory becomes available again for other request of dynamic memory.
</p>
<h4>SYNTAX:</h4>
<p>delete pointer-variable;</p>
<p>In the delete operator the pointer-variable is the pointer that points to the data object created by the new.
